# DG PBT Parser

## Description

The intention of this project is to create an executable that can synthesise info from PBT spreadsheets (portal runsheet.xlsx and weekly invoices.csv) into the required format for Divers Accounting.

As it currently stands, making spreadsheets each month is an extremely tedious job that honestly nobody sane should be doing. Unfortunately, there is no public PBT API (or maybe we just don't have access to it (¬_¬")) which limits everything to just the spreadsheets.
